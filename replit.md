# Overview

This is a comprehensive multi-language quantum protein folding system implementing AlphaFold3 with quantum computing enhancements. The system integrates Julia for high-performance scientific computing, Python for quantum integrations and service coordination, and Phoenix/Elixir for real-time web interfaces and distributed processing. The application combines classical machine learning with quantum computing backends to perform protein structure prediction with enhanced accuracy.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Technologies

**Julia Scientific Computing Core**: Julia serves as the primary computational engine, handling matrix operations, machine learning workloads, and quantum algorithm implementation. The system uses StaticArrays and LoopVectorization for performance optimization, with CUDA support for GPU acceleration.

**Python Integration Layer**: Python acts as the orchestration layer, providing async wrappers for quantum backends and managing external service integrations. The quantum_integration.py module interfaces with IBM Quantum services while maintaining classical fallbacks.

**Phoenix Web Framework**: Elixir/Phoenix handles the web interface and real-time communications through LiveView. The system uses Phoenix PubSub for distributed messaging and provides real-time updates on computation progress.

## Data Architecture

**Multi-Backend Data Storage**: The system integrates multiple data storage solutions:
- DragonflyDB for high-performance Redis-compatible caching
- Upstash Redis for distributed caching and session management
- Upstash Vector Search for protein structure similarity searches

**Scientific Data Formats**: Uses HDF5 and JLD2 for storing computational results and protein structures, with CSV support for data interchange.

## Quantum Computing Integration

**Hybrid Classical-Quantum Pipeline**: The architecture implements a fallback system where quantum computations are attempted first (via IBM Quantum or IonQ), with automatic fallback to classical algorithms if quantum backends are unavailable or timeout.

**Multi-Provider Support**: Supports multiple quantum computing providers (IBM Quantum, IonQ) through unified client interfaces, allowing dynamic backend selection based on availability and problem requirements.

## Performance and Scalability

**Distributed Processing**: Uses Julia's distributed computing capabilities with SharedArrays for parallel processing across multiple cores and nodes.

**Cloud Integration**: Integrates with Modal for serverless function deployment, IONOS for cloud infrastructure, and NVIDIA for GPU compute resources.

**Real-time Monitoring**: Phoenix LiveView provides real-time monitoring of computation progress, with WebSocket connections for live updates.

## Security and Authentication

**Token-based Authentication**: Uses secure token authentication for all external service integrations (quantum backends, cloud services, GPU resources).

**Environment-based Configuration**: All sensitive credentials are managed through environment variables with proper validation and error handling.
